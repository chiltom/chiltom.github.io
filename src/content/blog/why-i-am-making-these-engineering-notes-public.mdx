Building software involves a lot of decisions.

Some are obvious in hindsight. Many aren’t. And a surprising number of them are easy to forget once you’ve moved on to the next problem.

Over time, I noticed a pattern in my own projects: I’d make a choice that felt well-reasoned at the time, only to come back weeks or months later and wonder _why_ I did it that way. The context was gone, the tradeoffs were fuzzy, and all that remained was the result.

This site exists mostly because of that.

I’ve worked across full-stack development and data engineering, touching a pretty wide range of technologies along the way — APIs, data pipelines, frontend frameworks, infrastructure tooling. What surprised me wasn’t how hard any individual tool was to learn, but how often the real difficulty came from deciding _what not to use_, or _how much complexity was actually justified_.

Those decisions are rarely clean. They’re shaped by constraints, incomplete information, overengineered online advice, and whatever you happen to know at the time.

Most documentation explains _how_ to use a tool. A lot of blog and forum posts explain _what the author ultimately chose_. Very few spend time on the messy middle — the uncertainty, the false starts, the things that almost worked but didn’t quite.

I wanted a place to capture that middle.

This site is my attempt to do that. It’s a public notebook where I can write through problems I’m actively encountering: why I chose one approach over another, what I tried first, what didn’t work, and what I’d probably do differently next time.

Sometimes that will involve specific technologies. Sometimes it’ll be more about architecture, tradeoffs, or project structure. And sometimes it’ll just be me trying to articulate a vague feeling that something may be more or less complicated than it needs to be.

I don’t expect everything here to be “right.” In fact, I expect some posts to age poorly as I learn more. That’s fine — maybe even the point. The goal isn’t to publish final answers, but to document how I got from question to decision. That has helped me learn more than anything else.

If you’re reading this because you’re working through similar problems, I hope you find something useful here — even if it’s just a different way of thinking about the same issue. And if nothing else, writing this down helps me build more thoughtfully, which makes it worthwhile on its own.

I invite conversation at any time - let's chat about perspectives.
