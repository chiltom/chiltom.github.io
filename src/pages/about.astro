		Hi, I'm Tom 👋
	</p>

	<p>
		I'm a full-stack software engineer passionate about building robust, scalable systems that solve real problems. This blog is my digital notebook—a place where I document what I learn, share what works (and what doesn't), and help others avoid the mistakes I've made.
	</p>

	<h2>What I Do</h2>

	<p>
		I work across the full stack, from database design and backend APIs to frontend interfaces and DevOps infrastructure. I believe in choosing the right tool for the job, writing maintainable code, and always learning from production.
	</p>

	<h2>What I Write About</h2>

	<ul>
		<li><strong>Backend Architecture:</strong> API design, database patterns, caching strategies</li>
		<li><strong>Frontend Development:</strong> React patterns, state management, performance optimization</li>
		<li><strong>System Design:</strong> Scalability, reliability, and architectural decision-making</li>
		<li><strong>DevOps & Infrastructure:</strong> CI/CD, containerization, cloud deployments</li>
		<li><strong>Engineering Culture:</strong> Best practices, debugging techniques, lessons learned</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>This Blog</h2>

	<p>
		I started Tom's Notes as a way to learn in public and give back to the developer community. Every post here represents something I've wrestled with, figured out, or wish I'd known earlier in my career.
	</p>

	<p>
		If even one person avoids a mistake I've made or learns something useful from these notes, then this blog has served its purpose.
	</p>

	<h2>Outside of Work</h2>

	<p>
		When I'm not debugging production issues or exploring new technologies, you'll find me [add personal interests: contributing to open source / hiking / reading sci-fi / building side projects / etc.].
	</p>

	<h2>Get in Touch</h2>

	<p>
		I'm always interested in connecting with other engineers, discussing technical challenges, or collaborating on interesting projects.
